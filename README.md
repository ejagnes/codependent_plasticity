## Repository organisation

Each folder contains the code to run simulations and generate figures. Currently six folders are accessible and shortly additional folders will be uploaded here.

Folder "voltage_STDP" for figure 2b

Folder "frequency_STDP" for figure 2c,e

Folder "distance_STDP" for figure 2h-j

Folder "EI_balance" for figure 4c,d

Folder "receptive_filed_plasticity" for figure 5

Folder "dendrites" for figure 6

Folder "recurrent/learning" for figure 7 (available soon)

Folder "recurrent/recall" for figure 8 (available soon)

## Coding language and compilers

The code is written to run on Intel Fortran compiler. Plots are generated with gnuplot. To run the code from this repository you need both Intel Fortran (ifx or ifort) and Gnuplot installed on a linux machine (not tested on Windows or iOS).

Figures in the original article were generated with gnuplot and edited with Inkscape.
